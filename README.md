# Authentication-System
The authentication system is designed which lets user sign up and log in
using their chosen username and password. The system incorporates robust security mechanisms such
as password hashing using a computationally intense hash function (scrypt), along with 'salt' and
'pepper' techniques to enhance protection against brute force and rainbow table attacks. Moreover, it
incorporates features to ensure the chosen username and password adhere to specific criteria, it
validates that passwords are not included in any database of weak or breached passwords, and it
prevents the use of usernames with offensive or inappropriate language.
